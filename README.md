# LM Studio Installer
This script automates fetching the latest version info, then downloading and installing LM Studio.

## How to
```
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

## Limitations
This will only work to get the latest Linux x64 image (the script can me modified to target other versions)
